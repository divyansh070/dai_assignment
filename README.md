# DAI Assignment

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for the DAI (Data Analysis and Insights) assignment. The notebook includes data preprocessing, visualization, and basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Reads data from CSV files and performs basic cleaning operations such as handling missing values and removing duplicates.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generates summary statistics, visualizes data distributions, and identifies patterns or anomalies in the dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful charts, such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts new meaningful features from existing data to improve model performance.
- **Data Transformation**: Includes normalization, scaling, and encoding techniques to prepare data for further processing.
- **Basic Statistical Analysis**: Computes mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and other statistical measures.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies and handles outliers using statistical methods and visualization techniques.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries:

```terminal /bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## File Structure
- `dai_assignment.ipynb` - The Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis.
- `data_core.csv`- dataset used in this work
